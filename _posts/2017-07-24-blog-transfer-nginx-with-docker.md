I'm very impressed with Docker containerization, and while studying it, I just wanted to try some of the basic things I've learned. If you're not familiar with Containerization and Docker, let me explain it in simple words.

* Container is an isolated set of packages including libraries, applications that are completely independent of its surroundings.

* Docker is a container, which packages up an application and all its dependencies.

My plan is to use `Nginx` as the webserver and run it in a Docker container. Then I'll generate my site from Nikola and deploy it in the Nginx server.

1. Install Docker CE, how-to-install-docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/debian/#install-using-the-repository

2. Download Nginx image
```Shell
sudo docker pull nginx:latest
```

3. Port forwarding, before I initialize and run the container, I need to decide which port I'm going to use to redirect from my host server to the container. Here I'm using port `80->80` forwarding.

4. The deployment directory of Nginx is, `/usr/share/nginx/html`. This directory needs to be mapped with a host server directory. 
	* Directory map `/home/user/www/output -> /usr/share/nginx/html`

5. Create and run the container
```Shell
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 --name=WebServer1 -v /home/user/www/output:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx:latest
```
	* `p` option is used to forward the ports.

	* `name` is the container name.

	* `v` direcotry mapping with host and container.

This will create a container called `WebServer1` based on Nginx image and deploy the files in `/home/user/www/output/` directory.
